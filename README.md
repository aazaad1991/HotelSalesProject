From the hotel sales data, we answer a few questions the stakeholders have which are:
  1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
  Ans: The hotel revenue is increasing year by year. There is an upward trend in the revenue of      the hotel. The revenue is calculated by adding the Stays on weeknights and Stays on weekends 
  times the average daily rate minus the discount.
  2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
  Ans: The Parking percentage shows us how many hotel guests had personal cars relative to the   
  total nights of stay in the hotel throughout the year. Since the parking percentage is low we do 
  not need to increase our parking lot size.
  3. What trends can we see in the data?
  Ans: We see that out of the two hotel types, city hotels bring in more revenue. The revenues 
  increase in summer every year and go down before winter showing a seasonal trend.
